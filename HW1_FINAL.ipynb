    "Indeed, STA130 Homework essentially boils down to completing various understanding confirmation exercises oriented around coding and writing tasks.\n",

But when you find yourself frustrated with a ChatBots inability to give you the results you're looking for, this is a \"hint\" that you've become overreliant on the ChatBots. Your objective should not be to have ChatBots \"do the work for you\", but to use ChatBots to help you build your understanding so you can efficiently leverage ChatBots (and other resources) to help you work more efficiently.<br><br>\n",

    "You learned how to use df.dropna() to remove rows or columns with missing values and how del df['col'] can be used to delete specific columns.\n",

    "Example and Error Handling:\n",

    "When you attempted to delete a column using del df['Type 2'], an error occurred because the DataFrame (df) was not defined. We resolved this by first loading the dataset into df and then successfully deleting the column.\n",
